Tesla was becoming more and more\n        popular and I saw what they were doing with Machine Learning and A.I; So\n        I made these my focus. I was drawn towards this path because I wanted to\n        help develop life-changing technologies that impact and shape the world\n        we live in.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Near the end of my schooling career, I was afforded an opportunity to\n        become a Frontend Software Engineer and in doing so have found that\n        there are more ways to impact and shape the world than disrupting the\n        automotive industry.\n      </p>\n      <Divider />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n"],
